#  Managing Overseas Employment Contracts with Blockchain
Using Blockchain to Manage Overseas Employment Contracts  <br>
<br>


(Insert Name) is a proof of concept program that will demonstrate the solution provided in the following paper: <br>
ww.google.com



## Prerequisites 
--------------
<br>
This program has been tested mainly on the Linux operating system. <br>
 So, I recommend using Ubuntu to try this application <br>
 <br>

In addition, To Ubuntu, you will need to install the following: 

- Golang
- curl
- Docker
-  [Fablo](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fablo)

<br>

## Installation
---------------
<br>



Inside BlockChain folder run this command :
``` 
    sudo fablo recreate
```

When the network finishes setting up run this command: 
``` 
    go run Main/Main.go
```

Now interact with the system as much as you want.
* sudo Fablo prune will shut done the network, including all stored information.
* sudo Fablo recreate will reset the network.

<br>

## Fablo Installation | Setting Up The Environment
-----
<br>

If you need help setting up Fablo, this guide will help you. <br>
Be aware that we will assume this is a fresh installation of Ubuntu OS.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt --yes install software-properties-common
sudo apt install --yes golang
sudo apt-get install -y jq
sudo apt-get install -y curl
sudo apt install docker --yes
sudo apt install docker.io --yes
sudo apt install docker-compose --yes
```

After setting up the environment we will install Fablo
```
sudo curl -Lf https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fablo/releases/download/1.1.0/fablo.sh -o /usr/local/bin/fablo && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fablo
```

## Examples

### **Example 2 - Create Contract (Simple)**


Creating a contract involves many variables, so I made a method that will streamline the process. <br>
This method will only require a contract id to run. The rest of the variables will be filled by the system. <br>

Creating a contract from scratch involes alot of vairables.
This is why I need you to go to the file Main/contract.json. 
In that file you will find a valid contract. Please change whatever value you desire.
Kindly don't mess with the structure of the contract.
After changing the values of the contract save the json file and press ENTER.
```
<font size = "4" > [contract.json](Main/contract.json) </font>


**Output** <br>
<font size = "2" > We will read the contract to see changes id = 10 </font>
